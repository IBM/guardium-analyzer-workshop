Keep this link handy we will get back to this at [First Time Login to IBM Security Guardium Analyzer](#first-time-login-to-ibm-security-guardium-analyzer) step.

### Setup Database

`IBM Security Guardium Analyzer` helps you efficiently identify risk associated with personal and sensitive personal data (PII, PHI, PCI, etc.) that falls under regulations such as the E.U.â€™s GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA and other privacy mandates. The service applies next-generation data classification, as well as vulnerability scanning, to uncover privacy risks associated with such data in cloud-based and on-prem databases.

#### Supported Databases

Guardium Analyzer v1.0 scans on-premises and cloud databases including db2, Oracle, and
Microsoft SQL Server. 

Guardium Analyzer can scan databases that are either installed on an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solution (a cloud VM, for example) or hosted by a cloud provider as long as they are still db2, Oracle or SQL Server.

AWS RDS Oracle is fully tested, and we are testing Azure-MSSQL next.

#### Setup DB2 Database

Note: If you already have a data you would like to scan you can skip the step to setup a DB2 Database and use your own database on-prem or cloud based on [Supported Databases](#supported-databases)

For this workshop we will walkthrough how we can setup a DB2 Database and bootstrap the datababse with `db2sample`

##### Prerequisites

1. Install Docker: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
2. A Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS physical or VM image (this what will use for this workshop)

##### Pull down DB2 Express C

```bash
$ docker run -it -p 50000:50000 -e DB2INST1_PASSWORD=db2inst1-pwd -e LICENSE=accept   -v  $(pwd):/share  ibmcom/db2express-c:latest bash
```

`-p 50000:50000` exposes port `50000` to allow connections from the remote client.

By specifying `-e DB2INST1_PASSWORD=db2inst1-pwd` parameter, you set a password of your choice for the db2inst1 user for the default DB2 instance.

By specifying `-e LICENSE=accept` parameter, you are accepting this License to use the software contained in this image.

`/share`, referring to mount point at "/share" in the Docker.

`$(pwd)`, the current directory on Docker host while running Docker command, which is mounted by Docker container. It can also be any existing directory on Docker host, like `/tmp`, `/opt`, etc.

##### Start DB2 and create sample DB

Note: You will be running these with in the DB2 Express C docker container

1. Login to `db2inst1` account

```bash
$ su - db2inst1
```

2. Start DB2

```bash
$ db2start
```

Should see `SQL1063N  DB2START processing was successful.` on a succesful DB2 Start.

3. Create a DB2 Sample Database

```bash
$ db2sampl
```

Should see the following on a successful DB2 Sample Database creation:

```

  Creating database "SAMPLE"...
  Connecting to database "SAMPLE"...
  Creating tables and data in schema "DB2INST1"...
  Creating tables with XML columns and XML data in schema "DB2INST1"...

  'db2sampl' processing complete.

```

4. Connect to DB2 Sample Database

```bash
$ db2 connect to sample
```

On a successful connection you should see: 

```
   Database Connection Information

 Database server        = DB2/LINUXX8664 10.5.5
 SQL authorization ID   = DB2INST1
 Local database alias   = SAMPLE
```

Note: Keep this terminal active as this will keep DB2 active and exposed to the network to access it. We will scan this database using the `IBM Security Data Connector`.
